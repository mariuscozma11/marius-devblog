# Developer Blog Appwith NestJS and NextJS

I’ve had this idea for a while. It’s nothing original, but it’s a good project to practice backend development (auth, security, testing). The purpose of this blog is to be a place where I can share my thoughts while building software. I’m more of a documentation-first, develop-later type of developer, so having a space to organize my thought process while improving my skills feels really valuable, while contributing to open-source.

# Security Plan

I’m not aiming to over-engineer, but for learning purposes I want to ensure my endpoints are properly secured and that the admin page is accessible only to me, even though it’s technically public. Since this app has just one admin user, I know this isn’t the most efficient approach to security, but I’m taking it as an exercise in building good practices. 

# Blog Frontend

I've decided to use NextJs as my frontend framework to go for this project, because I want to get a better grasp of React, and because of it's static site generation performance. Being more of a technical person, I will use the  TailwindCSS  Framework to help me build an attractive UI, without too much of a headache
