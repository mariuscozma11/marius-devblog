# Developer Blog Appwith NestJS and NextJS

I’ve had this idea for a while. It’s nothing original, but it’s a good project to practice backend development (auth, security, testing). The purpose of this blog is to be a place where I can share my thoughts while building software. I’m more of a documentation-first, develop-later type of developer, so having a space to organize my thought process while improving my skills feels really valuable, while contributing to open-source.
